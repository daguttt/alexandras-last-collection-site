# File naming

- Favor kebab-case over camelCase
- Include the type of the file in the name
    - Examples:
        - `grouped-galleries.component.tsx`
        - `piece-card.component.tsx`

# Import and exports

- Favor named exports over default exports

## Using environemnt variables

- Make sure to use the `env` constant from `src/env.ts` file for type-safe access to environment variabes
